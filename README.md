## Scripts Overview ##

This repository contains a collection of useful Linux scripts for system setup, security, automation, and Docker management. Below is a brief description of each script:



## 1. install_stuff.sh ##

Installs a set of commonly used tools on Ubuntu systems, including:
	â€¢	tree, curl, wget, fail2ban, unzip, zip, rsync, git, and nfs-common.
Optional tools like net-tools, vim, and nano are also available (commented out).



## 2. sleep_torture.sh ##

Disables all sleep, suspend, hibernate, and hybrid sleep modes on the system by editing the /etc/systemd/sleep.conf file and restarting systemd-logind.



## 3. docker_install_lazy.sh ## 

Simplifies Docker installation by:
* Installing Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Ubuntu.
* Adding the current user to the docker group to allow running Docker without sudo.
* Creates the folders/files: 
    - /docker/appdata/docker-compose.yml



## 4. compose_path.sh

Sets up environment paths related to Docker Compose. Prepares the system to ensure Docker Compose is available globally and can be used easily in scripts or interactive shells.

The command "compose" can be used in any folder such as:
* "compose down"
* "compose up -d"


## 5. safe_shutdown_restart.sh ##

### Creates two convenient commands: ###

* **power:** 
    - Safely shuts down the system after stopping Docker containers by doing docker compose down.

* **reboot:** 
    - Safely reboots the system after stopping Docker containers by doing a docker compose down.

* Also adds a cron job to automatically start Docker containers after reboot.


## 6. auto_install.sh ##

Automates the installation of terminal enhancements, making auto completion working with many more enhancements. look in terminal_plastic_operation for pics and more info.

## 7. ssh_security.sh ##

Enhances SSH server security by:

* Enables PubkeyAuthentication

* Disabling root login over SSH.
	
* Disabling password authentication (forcing key-based        authentication).
	
* Restarting the SSH service to apply the changes.

## 8. ufw.sh ##
